					<p>I've been taking friends and family sinced I moved to Seattle in 2009, and one of best tastes they won't forget is the variety of coffee shops in the area. Home of Starbucks, Seattle has a reputation for being the coffee center of the world.  We'll begin (and end the tour) downtown at the first Starbucks in Pike's Place Market. We'll do a sample tasting to wet our palate and lunch items can be purchased. We will use local transportation (provided) and move to different coffee shops in the downtown area. Extra trips and special requests can be accommodated with advance notice. A sample itineary as follows:</p>
					<p>1:00pm - Meet up at the first Starbucks at Pike's Place market</p>
					<p>1:30pm - Top Pot Doughnuts</p>
					<p>2:00pm - Moore Coffee Shop</p>
					<p>2:30pm - Cloud City Coffee</p>
					<p>3:00pm - El Diablo Coffee Co</p>
					<p>3:30pm - Starbucks Roastery</p>
					<p>4:00pm - Tour ends</p>
